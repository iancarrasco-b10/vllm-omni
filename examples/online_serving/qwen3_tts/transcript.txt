Hey, Emily! I've been thinking about making a difference lately. Maybe volunteering or starting a campaign? "What do you think?" asked Henry as they walked home from school. Emily's eyes lit up. "That's an awesome idea, Henry!" I've been feeling the same way. There are so many causes we could support.
